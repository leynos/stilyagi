"""Blocking code-duplication gate over the pinned nose detector.

The gate runs the pinned ``nose`` binary with the repository's ``[tool.nose]``
settings, removes families covered by reasoned ``[tool.duplication_gate]``
allow entries, and fails while unsuppressed families remain. Stale allow
entries are reported so that resolved duplication does not leave dead
configuration behind.

``scripts/duplication_allowlist.py`` documents the allow-entry key syntax
and matching rules; ``scripts/nose_detector.py`` owns the detector itself.

The gate adjudicates the ranked families ``[tool.nose] top`` selects, not
every family the detector can find. Raising ``top`` or lowering ``min-size``
widens the checked surface; neither is a substitute for adjudicating what the
current settings report.
