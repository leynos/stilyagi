"""Replace files atomically through a temporary sibling.

A neutral persistence helper used by the duplication allowlist writer. It
belongs to no caller's domain: the write-temporary-then-``Path.replace``
sequence with its knobs is wanted by other tooling too, so the routine lives
on its own rather than in whichever module needed it first.
