# Usage guide

## Packaging the Vale style with `stilyagi`

- `uv sync --group dev` (or `make build`) should be run once so the `stilyagi`
  entry point is available locally.
- `stilyagi zip` should be invoked from the repository root to create a
  distributable ZIP that contains `.vale.ini` plus the full `styles/` tree.

### Default workflow

1. `make build` (installs dependencies when needed).
2. `uv run stilyagi zip`
3. Retrieve the archive from `dist/concordat-<version>.zip` and attach it to
   the release currently being prepared.

Running the command without flags auto-discovers available styles and the sole
vocabulary (`concordat`). The `.vale.ini` header matches `[*.{md,adoc,txt}]` to
cover Markdown, AsciiDoc, and text files.

### Customisation

- `--archive-version` can be used to override the archive suffix (for example,
  `uv run stilyagi zip --archive-version 2025.11.07`). When omitted, the value
  from `pyproject.toml` is used.
- `--style` (repeatable) limits the archive to specific style directories when
  more styles are added later. Without this flag, every non-config style in
  `styles/` is included.
- `--output-dir` changes the destination directory (defaults to `dist`).
- `--project-root` should be supplied when running the command from outside the
  repository so the path anchors every other relative argument.
- `--ini-styles-path` sets the directory recorded in `StylesPath` inside the
  archive (defaults to `styles`). The same value controls where style files are
  emitted in the ZIP.
- `--force` overwrites an existing archive in the output directory.
- Environment variables with the `STILYAGI_` prefix should be set when running
  under CI. For example, `STILYAGI_VERSION` mirrors `--archive-version`,
  `STILYAGI_STYLE` accepts a comma-separated list of style names, and
  `STILYAGI_INI_STYLES_PATH` mirrors `--ini-styles-path`.

### Verifying the artefact locally

1. Regenerate the archive via `uv run stilyagi zip --force`.
2. Unzip the resulting file and inspect `.vale.ini` to confirm it references the
   expected style list and vocabulary.
3. Validate the package inside a consumer repository by running
   `vale sync --packages dist/<archive>.zip`.

## Release

The `release` GitHub Actions workflow at `.github/workflows/release.yml` keeps
the Concordat Vale package in sync with tagged releases. It runs whenever a
GitHub release is published or when a maintainer manually dispatches the
workflow. The job resolves the correct archive version, installs the UV tool
chain, packages the styles with `stilyagi zip --archive-version <version>`, and
publishes the resulting ZIP straight to the matching release.

### Workflow overview

1. Trigger: either publishing a GitHub release (`release.published`) or a
   manual `workflow_dispatch`. Dispatchers must provide an existing release tag
   (for example `v0.1.0`) and may override the archive version.
2. Metadata: the `Resolve release metadata` step reads the event payload (or
   the dispatch inputs) to derive `tag` and `version`. When `archive_version`
   is omitted, the workflow strips the leading `v`/`V` from the tag and uses
   what remains.
3. Packaging: dependencies are installed via `uv sync --group dev --frozen`,
   then `uv run stilyagi zip --force` emits `dist/concordat-<version>.zip` and
   records the artefact path for later steps.
4. Upload: `gh release upload` attaches the freshly generated archive to the
   release that supplied the tag, replacing any older asset with the same name.

### Triggering a new Concordat release

1. Update `pyproject.toml` with the desired semantic version, document the
   changes, and land the pull request.
2. Create and push an annotated tag that matches the published version
   (for example
   `git tag -a v0.2.0 -m "Concordat v0.2.0" && git push origin v0.2.0`).
3. Draft a GitHub release that references the tag, add the release notes, and
   press **Publish release**. Publishing automatically starts the workflow and
   attaches `concordat-0.2.0.zip` to the release once it finishes.
4. To re-run the packaging step (for example if an upload was removed), open
   the workflow’s **Run workflow** form, supply the same `release_tag`, and
   optionally pass a replacement `archive_version`.

## Consuming the Concordat Vale style

Releases expose a ready-to-sync ZIP that contains `.vale.ini`, the Concordat
style files, and the supporting vocabulary. Consumers should download the
artefact from <https://github.com/leynos/concordat-vale/releases>, run
`vale sync --packages <url>`, then reference the style in their configuration.

### Example `.vale.ini`

```ini
StylesPath = styles
MinAlertLevel = suggestion
Packages = https://github.com/leynos/concordat-vale/releases/download/v0.1.0/concordat-0.1.0.zip

[*.{md,adoc,txt}]
BasedOnStyles = Vale, concordat
```

This configuration downloads the `v0.1.0` artefact into `styles/` (when
`vale sync --packages ...` is executed) and enables the Concordat checks for
Markdown, AsciiDoc, and plain-text files alongside Vale’s defaults.

### Example `vale` Makefile target

```makefile
VALE ?= vale
VALE_PACKAGES ?= https://github.com/leynos/concordat-vale/releases/download/v0.1.0/concordat-0.1.0.zip
VALE_TARGETS ?= docs/**/*.md README.md

.PHONY: vale
vale:
	$(VALE) sync --packages $(VALE_PACKAGES)
	$(VALE) --minAlertLevel suggestion $(VALE_TARGETS)
```

Running `make vale` synchronises the packaged Concordat release before linting
the selected documentation paths. Override `VALE_PACKAGES` (for example in CI)
to pin a different release URL, and adjust `VALE_TARGETS` to match the files in
your repository.
