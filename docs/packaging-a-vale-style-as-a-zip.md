# Packaging a Vale style as a ZIP (with Tengo scripts & vocabulary)

This guide shows how to ship a Vale v3 style as a single distributable ZIP that includes:

* one or more styles (YAML rules);
* Tengo scripts for custom rules and/or fix-suggestion actions;
* vocabulary lists (accept/reject) and optional Hunspell dictionaries.

It also covers how a consumer references the package via `Packages` + `vale sync`.

---

## 1) Repository layout (before zipping)

Structure your style repository like this:

```
.
├─ .vale.ini                  # “complete package” config (points at styles/)
└─ styles/
   ├─ MyStyle/                # your style rules (YAML)
   │  ├─ 00-Intro.yml
   │  └─ MyRule.yml
   └─ config/                 # shared resources for all styles
      ├─ scripts/             # Tengo for `extends: script` rules
      │  └─ MyScript.tengo
      ├─ actions/             # Tengo for suggestion/fixer actions
      │  └─ CamelToSnake.tengo
      ├─ vocabularies/        # per-vocabulary name directories
      │  └─ myvocab/
      │     ├─ accept.txt
      │     └─ reject.txt
      └─ dictionaries/        # optional Hunspell .dic/.aff
         ├─ en_GB.dic
         └─ en_GB.aff
```

**Why these paths?**
Vale resolves non-style resources under `styles/config/*`:

* **`config/scripts/`** is the search root for `script:` in `extends: script` rules.
* **`config/actions/`** is the search root for Tengo scripts used by `action: { name: suggest }` fixers.
* **`config/vocabularies/<name>/accept.txt|reject.txt`** ships organisation vocab.
* **`config/dictionaries/`** ships Hunspell files for spelling rules (optional).

---

## 2) Minimal rule wiring

### (a) A Tengo-backed rule

```yaml
# styles/MyStyle/MyRule.yml
extends: script
message: 'Custom structural check fired.'
level: warning
scope: raw            # or 'sentence', etc., as needed
script: MyScript.tengo  # resolved from styles/config/scripts/
```

Place `MyScript.tengo` in `styles/config/scripts/`.

### (b) A rule with a Tengo suggestion action (fixer)

Use this when the rule itself is regex-driven, but you want dynamic suggestions:

```yaml
# styles/MyStyle/CamelToSnake.yml
extends: existence
message: "'%s' should be snake_case."
nonword: true
level: error
tokens:
  - '[A-Z]\w+[A-Z]\w+'

action:
  name: suggest
  params:
    - CamelToSnake.tengo   # resolved from styles/config/actions/
```

Place `CamelToSnake.tengo` in `styles/config/actions/`.

> Tip: keep actions small and pure; return a single best suggestion or a short list.

---

## 3) Vocabulary files (accept/reject)

Ship a vocabulary named `myvocab`:

```
styles/config/vocabularies/myvocab/accept.txt
styles/config/vocabularies/myvocab/reject.txt
```

* **`accept.txt`**: words/terms to *allow* (prevent false positives).
* **`reject.txt`**: words/terms to *discourage* (raise alerts if seen).

Lines are one token per line; keep them canonical (e.g., “microservice”, “WebSocket”), and prefer the singular base form unless you need inflected variants.

To use this vocab in the package’s own config (see §4), set `Vocab = myvocab`. Consumers can keep that or override with their own.

---

## 4) The package’s `.vale.ini`

Include a minimal config at the root of the ZIP that points at `styles/` and enables your style (and vocab):

```ini
# .vale.ini (inside the ZIP)
StylesPath = styles

[*.{md,adoc,txt}]
BasedOnStyles = MyStyle
Vocab = myvocab
```

This makes the ZIP a **complete package**: when a consumer syncs it, Vale knows where to load everything.

---

## 5) Build the ZIP

From the repo root:

```bash
zip -r MyStyle-1.2.3.zip .vale.ini styles/
```

Attach `MyStyle-1.2.3.zip` to a GitHub Release (or host it anywhere with a stable URL).

Version your ZIPs (e.g., SemVer) so consumers can pin or upgrade deterministically.

---

## 6) How consumers install and use it

In the **consuming** repository:

**.vale.ini**

```ini
# Consumer project
StylesPath = .github/styles

# Point to your release asset; multiple packages allowed (order = precedence)
Packages = https://github.com/you/your-style/releases/download/v1.2.3/MyStyle-1.2.3.zip

# Optionally extend/override the package defaults:
[*.{md,adoc,txt}]
BasedOnStyles = Vale, MyStyle
Vocab = myvocab
```

Then:

```bash
vale sync   # downloads/merges the package into StylesPath
vale .      # lint the repo
```

Notes:

* If multiple packages are listed, later entries take precedence when files collide.
* Consumers can override anything in your package by adding files under their local `StylesPath`.

---

## 7) Sanity checks

After `vale sync`, confirm the resources are visible:

* Your rules appear under the configured style name (`MyStyle`).
* A rule that references `MyScript.tengo` triggers as expected on sample text.
* A token in `reject.txt` raises an alert; a token in `accept.txt` is ignored by your spelling/term rules.

A quick project-local smoke test:

```bash
printf 'THISNeedsFixing\n' | vale --ext=.txt -
```

Expect your `CamelToSnake.yml` message and a suggested fix.

---

## 8) Private distribution & alternatives (optional)

* **Vendoring via Git**: instead of `Packages`, consumers can vendor your repo (or a release) into their tree (e.g., as a submodule) and set `StylesPath` accordingly. This avoids external fetches but shifts updates to Git ops.
* **Multiple styles per ZIP**: you can ship several style folders under `styles/` and reference them all from `.vale.ini`.

---

## 9) Release checklist

* [ ] All rule YAML under `styles/MyStyle/…`
* [ ] All `extends: script` Tengo in `styles/config/scripts/`
* [ ] All suggestion/fixer Tengo in `styles/config/actions/`
* [ ] Vocab in `styles/config/vocabularies/<name>/(accept|reject).txt`
* [ ] Optional Hunspell in `styles/config/dictionaries/`
* [ ] Root `.vale.ini` points `StylesPath = styles` and enables your style/vocab
* [ ] Versioned ZIP built from `.vale.ini` + `styles/`
* [ ] Release asset URL stable and documented for consumers

Ship it; consumers `vale sync` it; everyone gets the same rules, scripts, and vocabulary, versioned and reproducible.
