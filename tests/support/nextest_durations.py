"""Reading a nextest duration as the runner reads one.

Separated from ``timeout_budgets`` so the grammar and the budget
arithmetic stay legible apart, and so neither module outgrows the
400-line limit ``AGENTS.md`` sets.

nextest deserializes every duration with ``humantime_serde``. That
grammar is wider than one number and a short unit, and a reader
narrower than it refuses configuration nextest loads, which makes the
contract fail on a correct file and blame the file for it.

#: One value-and-unit pair of a duration as ``humantime`` spells it.
#: nextest deserializes every duration with ``humantime_serde``, which
#: reads a sequence of such pairs and sums them, so ``"1h 30m"``,
#: ``"1d"`` and ``"1w"`` are all configuration it accepts. A reader
#: taking a single component with a short unit rejects a file nextest
#: would load, and this contract would then blame the file for its own
#: limitation.
#:
#: Digits with whitespace tolerated between them. humantime's parser
#: skips whitespace while it accumulates a number, so ``"1 0s"`` is ten
#: seconds rather than a malformed duration, and the same holds either
#: side of the point: ``"1 2 . 3 4 s"`` is 12.34 seconds.
#:
#: The class is ``[0-9]`` and not ``\d``, which is the whole of the
#: difference between the two parsers here. Python's ``\d`` matches
#: every Unicode decimal digit and ``int`` reads them, so ``"\u0663\u0660\u0660s"``
#: became three hundred seconds; humantime's parser compares against
#: ``'0'..='9'`` and refuses the text, at offset 0 when the run opens
#: with one and at the first such character otherwise. A reader wider
#: than the parser certifies a configuration nextest cannot load.
_SPACED_DIGITS: typ.Final[str] = r"[0-9](?:\s*[0-9])*"

#: The grammar was measured against humantime 2.3.0, which is what the
#: lockfile of the pinned cargo-nextest release resolves (this
#: repository pins ``cargo-nextest@0.9.138``), by compiling that parser
#: and running the cases through it. The fractional part is optional and
#: humantime tolerates whitespace around the point, so ``"1.5m"`` and
#: ``"1 . 5 m"`` are both ninety seconds. A leading point, a missing
#: fractional part, a second point, a sign and a digit separator are all
#: refused there, and so are refused here.

#: reader that stripped first would accept a duration nextest rejects.

    humantime carries the running total as whole seconds beside a
    nanosecond remainder, and every product and sum between them is a
    checked ``u64``, so a total past either ceiling will not load even
    though each component did. Both ceilings are enforced here, in
    humantime's order.

    The remainder is bounded first, before any carry: ``add_current``
    opens with ``(out.subsec_nanos() as u64).add(nsec)?``, so the
    remainder held so far plus this component's nanoseconds must fit a
    ``u64`` by themselves. Two values of ``u64::MAX`` nanoseconds carry
    the first to 18,446,744,073 seconds and then overflow on the second,
    although the duration they name is about thirty-six seconds; a
    reader summing into Python's unbounded integer and checking only the
    seconds afterwards reports a duration for text nextest will not
    start under.

    The carry then happens at a complete second rather than past one.
    humantime's own ``add_current`` leaves exactly a billion in the
    remainder and hands it to ``Duration::new``, which carries it
    regardless and panics when the seconds then leave the ``u64``.
    Comparing with ``>`` alone reads ``"18446744073709551615s 1000ms"``
    as a duration one second past the ceiling, and nextest cannot load
    that text by either route. Carrying at a complete second keeps
    ``"0.5s 0.5s"`` a duration of one second, which humantime reads.

    ----------
    duration : str
