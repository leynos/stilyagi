"""humantime's unit table and its checked arithmetic.

Separated from ``nextest_durations`` so the grammar and the arithmetic
stay legible apart, and so neither module outgrows the 400-line limit
``AGENTS.md`` sets.

Every rule here was read out of humantime 2.3.0's own parser rather than
from its documentation: the unit tables, the checked ``u64`` operations,
the refusal of any fraction of a nanosecond, and the line at the hour
where a fraction stops converting into nanoseconds and starts converting
into whole seconds.
